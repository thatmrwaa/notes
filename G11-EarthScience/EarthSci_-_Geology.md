# Minerals
- *Minerals* are the primary component of rocks
- **MINERALS HELP WITH EARTH'S PROCESSES**
- *Phaneritic* texture is course-grained texture
- Minerals have to be *Naturally occurring, Inorganic, Homogeneous, Solids that have a defined chemical composition and crystalline structure* (NIHDO)
- *Polymorphism* is the ability of a specific chemical substance to crystallize in more than one configuration 
- *Mineraloids* are naturally occurring inorganic material, but are amorphous (No form)
## Physical Properties of Minerals
- The physical properties of minerals are *Color, Streak, Luster, Diaphaniety, Hardness, Habit*
- *Streak* is the color of a mineral in powdered form
	- *Metallic* minerals have a dark-colored streak. (Applies vice versa)
- *Luster* is the ability of a mineral to reflect light
	- Luster is divided into 
- *Diaphaniety* describes how well light passes through a mineral
	- Diaphaniety is divided into *Transparent, Translucent and Opaque*
- *Hardness* is the resistance of a mineral to abrasion or scratching
	- Moh's scale of hardness is *relative*
- *Crystal Habit* is the shapes and aggregates that a certain mineral is likely to form
	- Eg: Sheet-like, Platy, Fibrous
- *Cleavage* is the tendency of a material to break into particular "Directions"
	- *Fractures* or irregular breakages occur when bond strengths in a crystal structure is equal in all directions.
- *Specific Gravity* is the ratio of the density of a substance and the density of water
## Classification of minerals
- *Silicates and Non-Silicates* are the general classifications of minerals
- Minerals are classified based on *Composition and crystal structure*
- *Gangue minerals* are worthless minerals that are associated with ore minerals
- Most of the minerals that form our crust are *Silicates*
# Rocks
- *Igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic* are the three types of rocks
- *The rock cycle* shows the relationships among the three rock types
- The primary process in making magma is *Crystallization* 
- *Fracking* is pumping of water into minerals at high pressure 
## Igneous rocks
- The two types of igneous rocks are *Extrusive/Volcanic and Intrusive/Plutonic*
- Crystal size is determined by *the rate of cooling*
- Igneous rocks are produced through *Weathering, Transportation and Deposition*
- Igneous rocks are classified based on their *texture and mineral constituents*
- *Mafic and felsic* are the two types of magma
	- Mafic rocks are also called *granitic* rocks
		- Mafic rocks usually come from the *Land*
	- Felsic rocks are also called *basaltic* rocks
		- Felsic rocks usually come from the *Sea*
	- *Andasitic* rocks are the intermediate between mafic and felsic rocks
	- *Ultramafic* rocks form when the mantle reaches the surface through tectonics
- *Aphanitic* rocks are fine grained
- *Vesicular* rocks contain voids left by gas bubbles that escape as lava solidified
- The *Bowen's reaction series* tells of the stability of a mineral
	- As you go up from Ultra-Mafic to Felsic material the crystals become *simpler and less viscous*
	- *Silica* is what makes magma more viscous
## Sedimentary rocks
- Sedimentary rocks contain *Fossils*
- Based on the source of the material, sedimentary rocks are classified into *Detrital and Chemical* rocks
	- *Detrital* rocks are rocks that are formed from solid particles
	- Detrital rocks are classified in *particle size*
	- *Chemical* rocks are rocks that are derived from a solution
- Sedimentary rocks are produced through *lithification*
	- The two lithification processes are *Compaction and Cementation*
## Metamorphic rocks
- Metamorphic rocks are produced from *preexisting rocks*
- The two degrees of metamorphism are *low-grade and high-grade*
- The two metamorphic settings are *Contact/Thermal, and Regional*
- Most metamorphic rocks form through *regional metamorphism*
- *Heat, Pressure(Stress) and Chemically active fluids* are metamorphic agents
- Metamorphic rocks are classified as *Foliated or Nonfoliated*
	- *Foliated* metamorphic rocks are rocks where the minerals are perpendicular to the compressional force
	- *Nonfoliated* metamorphic rocks are rocks where the pressure was distributed equally on all sides 
# Weathering, Soil and Mass Wasting
The earth's external Forces are *Weathering, Mass wasting and Erosion*.
## Weathering
- Rocks exposed to the atmosphere *weather*
- *Weathering* is the disintegration of decomposition of material at/near the surface
	- *Spheroidal Weathering* is the process by which weathering works inward from exposed surfaces
	- *Regolith* is the byproduct of the protolith(Parent rock)
	- The rate of weathering is *Slower* when the rocks are more stable
	- *Differential weathering* is caused by variations in composition 
### Chemical and Mechanical weathering
- The process is split into *Chemical and Mechanical* weathering. (Physical Vs Chemical Change)
	- As particles become smaller, the rate of weathering *Increases*
	- The 4 types of Mechanical Weathering are *Frost wedging, Salt Crystal Growth, Sheeting, and Biological activity*
		- *Frost wedging* is the process by which freezing water expands
		- *Bioturbation* is the process by which biological activity erodes Rocks
	- **Chemical Weathering changes minerals to other minerals**
	- Chemical weathering is a *Low* temperature process
	- The most important agent in chemical weathering is *Water*
	- Weathering of silicate minerals produces *Clay minerals*
## Erosion and Soil
- *Soil* is a combination of regolith (Mineral Matter), water, air and organic matter
	- **Soil is 45% water, 25% air, 25% water and 5% organic matter*
	- Darkness in soil is caused by *organic matter*
	- *Air* makes soil softer, for plant roots to penetrate through
	- Soil is classified into *sand, silt and clay*, from largest to smallest
	- *Loam* is the ideal type of soil for plants
	- The controls of soil formation are *its parent material, time, slope and orientation*
### Soil erosion
- The processes that erode soil are *Water (...erosion) and wind (...erosion)*
- The natural rates of erosion depend on *Soil characteristics, Climate, Slope and Type of Vegetation*
- **Inter cropping stops soil erosion by forcing that the crops be harvested at different times**
## Mass wasting
- *Mass wasting* is the transfer of rock material down slope under the influence of gravity
- The triggers of mass wasting are *Water, Removal of vegetation and Earthquakes*
- The *angle of repose* is steepest angle of descent or dip relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping
- Poorly sorted material is *More* stable
- A *slump* is rapid movement along a curved surface
# Plate tectonics
`These notes are much less detailed, I assume you've already tackled this in your previous years`
- *Alfred Wegener* proposed the Continental drift hypothesis in 1915
- *Pangea* was the name of the 1st supercontinent
- The *theory of plate tectonics* says that earth has a rigid outer shell
	- The outermost layer of the earth is called the *Lithosphere*
	- The inner layer is called the *Asthenosphere*
- Divergent plate boundaries are also called *Constructive margins*
- Convergent plate boundaries are also called *Destructive margins*
- *Convection currents* move our plates
